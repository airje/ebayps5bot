# ebayps5bot
Run a program to buy a  PS5 on Ebay for $800 to $900. You can lower the price range but the lower you go the higher chance of it picking fakes. Auto fills your information. You just have to confirm the purchase.
Ebay's bot filter might catch you. Just fill the you are not a bot survey and run the program again.
